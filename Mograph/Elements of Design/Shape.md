## What is Shape?

In motion graphic design, shape refers to the two-dimensional elements that make up the composition, such as lines, circles, squares, triangles, and other geometric or organic forms. Shapes are an essential part of creating visual interest, structure, and balance within a motion graphic design.

Designers use shapes to create the overall layout and composition of a motion graphic, and to convey meaning and emotions through their form and arrangement. They can also use shapes to create a sense of rhythm and movement within the animation, by repeating or varying shapes throughout the sequence.

In kinetic typography, shapes are used to create dynamic and interesting typography animations. Designers can use shapes to emphasize key words or phrases, create a sense of movement and rhythm within the typography, and to add visual interest to the overall animation.

Overall, shape is an important element in motion graphic design as it can help to convey meaning, create structure and balance, and add visual interest and appeal to the design.

#### Importance of shape:

Shapes are fundamental building blocks of design, and can be used to create structure, balance, and contrast within a composition.

They can be used to convey meaning, such as using a circle to represent unity or a triangle to represent stability.

Shapes can be used to add visual interest and create a focal point within a design, by using contrasting or bold shapes.

Shapes can also be used to create a sense of rhythm and movement within a design, by repeating or varying shapes throughout a composition.

#### Guide to using shape:

Consider the meaning and associations of different shapes, and use them to convey a message or feeling.

Use contrasting shapes to add visual interest and create a sense of balance and hierarchy within a composition.

Vary the size, scale, and orientation of shapes to create a sense of rhythm and movement within a design.

Use negative space (the space between shapes) to create balance and harmony within a composition.

#### Dos and Don'ts of using shape:

Do use shapes to add structure, balance, and interest to your design.
