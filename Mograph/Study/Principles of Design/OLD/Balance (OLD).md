## What is balance?
Balance in motion graphic design refers to the distribution of visual elements within a composition to create a sense of stability, equilibrium, and harmony. It is an important principle of design that helps to create a cohesive and visually appealing composition.

Here are some important aspects of balance in motion graphic design, along with a guide on how to use it and apply it:

#### Importance of balance:

Balance helps to create a sense of stability and order within a composition, which can help to make it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to understand.
It can help to guide the viewer's eye through the design and emphasize important elements or messages.
A balanced composition can also create a sense of unity and harmony, making it more appealing and memorable to the viewer.

#### Guide to balance:

*Symmetrical balance:* This type of balance is achieved by dividing the composition into equal or nearly equal halves, with visual elements mirrored on either side. It creates a sense of stability and order, and is often used in more formal or traditional designs.

*Asymmetrical balance:* This type of balance is achieved by distributing visual elements unevenly within the composition, but still creating a sense of balance through careful placement and consideration of visual weight. It creates a sense of movement and dynamism, and is often used in more contemporary or artistic designs.

*Radial balance:* This type of balance is achieved by distributing visual elements around a central point or axis, creating a circular or spiral pattern. It creates a sense of movement and energy, and is often used in designs with a strong focal point or emphasis.

#### Dos and Don'ts of balance:

*Do* consider the visual weight of each element within the composition, and adjust the placement and size of each element accordingly.
*Do* use contrast and color to create a sense of balance and harmony within the composition.


*Don't* rely too heavily on symmetry or perfect balance, as this can create a static or boring composition.
*Don't* neglect negative space, which can be just as important as the visual elements in creating balance and harmony within the design.

#### How to use and apply balance:

Consider the purpose and context of your design, and choose the type of balance that best suits your message and audience.

Experiment with different layouts and arrangements of visual elements, and use design software or tools to help you achieve the desired balance.

Always be mindful of the visual weight and hierarchy of the elements within your composition, and adjust as necessary to create a balanced and harmonious design.
