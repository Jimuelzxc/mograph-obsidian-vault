## How to use Shape in (Kinetic Typography)
Here are some tips and techniques for using shapes in kinetic typography:

#### Do:

• Use simple geometric shapes like circles, squares, triangles, etc. These are easy to animate and transform. 

• Repeat and sequence shapes to create rhythm. But vary their size, color or movement to add dynamism. 

• Use shapes as frames or placeholders for text. Animate the shapes and text together. For example, have text rotate within a spinning circle shape.

• Morph shapes into one another. For example, transition a circle into a square into a triangle. This creates smooth transformations. 

• Scale, rotate and translate shapes for visual interest. Move shapes in time with the beat or rhythm of the soundtrack. 

• Use shapes as graphical elements on their own, not just as frames or placeholders. Animate shapes zooming in and out, bouncing, etc. to create motifs. 

• Combine and overlap multiple shapes. Animate them moving together or apart for dramatic effect.

• Use shapes that represent or symbolize ideas related to your message. For example, use heart shapes in a video about love.

#### Don't: 

• Use too many different shapes. Keep it simple and stick to 2-3 main shapes. Too many will make the design look chaotic.

• Move or animate shapes arbitrarily without purpose. The movement should relate to the overall concept, mood or soundtrack in some way. 

• Size and scale shapes disproportionately. Extreme sizing differences will make the composition look unbalanced. 

• Leave shapes static while other elements are animated. Either animate all design elements together or don't animate certain static elements at all. 

• Use distracting or irrelevant shapes that confuse the overall message or mood. Ensure a consistent visual theme is maintained.  

#### Other tips:

• Study examples of effective kinetic typography videos to see creative ways other designers have used shapes. Take inspiration from their techniques.

• Experiment with different shape animations and transformations to discover what you like. Then apply your preferred techniques to your work. 

• Time shape movements and animations to the beat or rhythm of the soundtrack. This helps create a cohesive feel between visuals and audio. 

• Use animation sequences and keyframes in your video editing software to precisely control shape movements. Don't just arbitrarily move elements around the screen.

• Keep practicing! The more you experiment, the more you will improve your kinetic typography skills.
