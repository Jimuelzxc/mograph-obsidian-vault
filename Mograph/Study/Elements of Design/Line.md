## What is line?
In *motion design* and *graphic design*, a "line" typically refers to a visual element that is used to create shapes, define edges, and communicate movement. Lines can be straight, curved, thick, thin, dashed, or solid, and they can be used in a multitude of ways to create different effects and convey different meanings.

In *motion design*, lines are often used to create movement and flow in animations and videos. For example, a line might be used to trace the movement of an object or to emphasize the trajectory of a camera. Lines can also be used to create dynamic transitions between scenes or to add visual interest to titles and credits.

In *graphic design*, lines are used to create structure, hierarchy, and emphasis in designs. They can be used to create borders, frames, and grids, or to divide content into sections. Lines can also be used to draw attention to specific elements in a design, such as a headline or a call-to-action button.

Overall, lines are a versatile design element that can be used in a variety of ways to create effective and engaging designs in both motion and graphic design.

## Importance of line / Kahalagan ng line
#### Creating Structure and Hierarchy
Lines can be used to create a sense of order and structure in a design. They can be used to divide content into sections, create grids, and establish a visual hierarchy that guides the viewer's eye through the design.
#### Providing Emphasis
Lines can be used to draw attention to specific elements in a design, such as headlines, images, or calls to action. A bold or colorful line can create a visual "pop" that helps important elements stand out.
#### Conveying Movement and Direction
In motion design, lines are often used to convey movement and direction. They can be used to trace the movement of objects, emphasize the trajectory of a camera, or create dynamic transitions between scenes.
#### Creating Texture and Depth
Lines can be used to create texture and depth in a design. For example, a series of thin lines can create the impression of a woven fabric or a wood grain.
#### Establishing Mood and Tone
The thickness, color, and style of lines can all contribute to the overall mood and tone of a design. A thin, delicate line might convey a sense of elegance or sophistication, while a thick, bold line might suggest strength or power.

## DO's & DON'Ts
#### Do
* Do use lines to create structure and hierarchy in your design. Thin lines can create separation and grid-like structures, while thicker lines can emphasize important elements and create contrast.
* Do consider the context in which your design will be viewed. Use thicker lines for smaller screens or low-resolution displays to ensure they are easily visible.
* Do use lines to guide the viewer's eye through your design. Use directional lines to emphasize important elements and create a sense of hierarchy.
* Do experiment with different line styles and textures to create visual interest in your design.
#### Don't
* Don't use too many lines in your design.
* Don't use lines that are too thin or too light.
* Don't use lines that clash with the overall style or tone of your design. Make sure the lines you use are consistent with the overall style and message of your design.
* Don't use lines that are too close together or too far apart. This can create an unbalanced and unappealing look.
* Don't use lines that are too complex or difficult to understand. Make sure the lines you use are easily recognizable and understandable to the viewer.
