## What is Depth
In *graphic design*, depth can be used to create a sense of hierarchy and to guide the viewer's eye through the composition. For example, elements that are closer to the viewer can be made larger and more prominent, while elements that are further away can be made smaller and less detailed.

In *motion design*, depth can be used to create a sense of immersion and realism. By animating elements in three-dimensional space, designers can create the illusion of objects moving towards or away from the viewer, or create parallax effects where objects closer to the camera appear to move faster than objects further away. This can make animations feel more dynamic and engaging.


## Pagkakaintindi ko sa Depth
ibig sabihin ng depth ay yung lalim ng element or layo kung baga para kang nasa 3d space pero 2d siya, like ilalayo mo yung isang layer/element or liliitan mo para mag mukang nasa malayo, malaki naman kapag malapit.


## Importance of depth or Kahalaganhan ng depth

#### Adds visual interest
#### Creates a sense of realism
#### Hierarchy
#### Enhances storytelling

## Guide of depth
#### Apply shading
#### Overlapping elements
#### Use size and scale
#### Create texture
#### Use parallax (Motion Design)
	closer elements is faster

## DO'S & DON'TS
#### Don't overuse depth
	to the point where it becomes distracting or confusing for the viewer.
Don't forget to consider the context and purpose of your design or animation when using depth. It may not always be necessary or appropriate.
