### How to use shape in (Kinetic Typography)

Shape is one of the fundamental elements of design. It refers to the two-dimensional outline of an object or figure. Shapes are important in design for the following reasons:
#### Pagkakaintindi ko sa shape
Ang shape ay nagpapakita ng form o anyo ng isang bagay o imahe. Ito ay isang mahalagang elemento sa disenyo dahil ito ay nakakatulong sa pagpapahayag ng mensahe o emosyon ng isang disenyo. Ang mga shape ay maaaring magbigay ng visual interest at contrast sa isang disenyo, at maaari rin itong magamit upang mag-organisa ng impormasyon o upang magbigay ng galaw at daloy sa disenyo. Sa madaling salita, ang shape ay isang mahalagang bahagi ng proseso ng disenyo.

#### Importance of shape:

• Shapes create visual interest and attract attention. Unique or unusual shapes stand out and capture the viewer's eye.

• Shapes communicate ideas and meanings. For example, a cross shape represents religion or health care, a heart shape represents love, a star shape represents ambition or excellence, etc. 

• Shapes help create visual balance, rhythm, and harmony in a design. Repeating or varying shapes in a layout creates a sense of flow and coherence.

• Shapes define spaces and provide visual boundaries. The areas within and around shapes become focal points in a design.  

#### Guidelines for using shape:

• Use a variety of shapes - don't just use squares and circles. Try triangles, pentagons, stars, etc. Variety creates more visual interest.

• Repeat and align shapes to create a sense of unity. But also contrast shapes to create focal points. 

• Use shapes that convey ideas and meanings relevant to your message or concept. 

• Overlap, intersect and rotate shapes to make new and interesting forms. 

• Ensure there is sufficient contrast between shapes - vary the sizes, tones, colors, etc. Lack of contrast will make shapes indistinct.  

#### In motion graphics and kinetic typography:

• Animating and transforming shapes (scaling, rotating, etc.) creates visual dynamism and motion. Move shapes onto the screen along a path or have them emerge from different directions. 

• Morph or transition between different shapes to create fluid transitions and visual interest. 

• Use shapes to frame and accentuate text elements. Animate the shapes and text together so that they transform in sync. 

• Repeat and sequence shapes with a rhythm - this rhythm and repetition will strengthen your overall visual message. But also introduce variations in color, scale or other attributes to build dynamism.

• Use shapes as graphic elements - they don't always have to be static or frame other elements. Animate shapes on their own as graphical motifs in your motion design.

## How to use Line in (Kinetic Typography)
Here are some tips and techniques for using shapes in kinetic typography:

#### Do:

• Use simple geometric shapes like circles, squares, triangles, etc. These are easy to animate and transform. 

• Repeat and sequence shapes to create rhythm. But vary their size, color or movement to add dynamism. 

• Use shapes as frames or placeholders for text. Animate the shapes and text together. For example, have text rotate within a spinning circle shape.

• Morph shapes into one another. For example, transition a circle into a square into a triangle. This creates smooth transformations. 

• Scale, rotate and translate shapes for visual interest. Move shapes in time with the beat or rhythm of the soundtrack. 

• Use shapes as graphical elements on their own, not just as frames or placeholders. Animate shapes zooming in and out, bouncing, etc. to create motifs. 

• Combine and overlap multiple shapes. Animate them moving together or apart for dramatic effect.

• Use shapes that represent or symbolize ideas related to your message. For example, use heart shapes in a video about love.

#### Don't: 

• Use too many different shapes. Keep it simple and stick to 2-3 main shapes. Too many will make the design look chaotic.

• Move or animate shapes arbitrarily without purpose. The movement should relate to the overall concept, mood or soundtrack in some way. 

• Size and scale shapes disproportionately. Extreme sizing differences will make the composition look unbalanced. 

• Leave shapes static while other elements are animated. Either animate all design elements together or don't animate certain static elements at all. 

• Use distracting or irrelevant shapes that confuse the overall message or mood. Ensure a consistent visual theme is maintained.  

#### Other tips:

• Study examples of effective kinetic typography videos to see creative ways other designers have used shapes. Take inspiration from their techniques.

• Experiment with different shape animations and transformations to discover what you like. Then apply your preferred techniques to your work. 

• Time shape movements and animations to the beat or rhythm of the soundtrack. This helps create a cohesive feel between visuals and audio. 

• Use animation sequences and keyframes in your video editing software to precisely control shape movements. Don't just arbitrarily move elements around the screen.

• Keep practicing! The more you experiment, the more you will improve your kinetic typography skills.
